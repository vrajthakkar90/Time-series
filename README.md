# Time-series
This repository contains the course project on Time Series. We got the temperature data from the Indian Meteorological Department. We tried fitting ARIMA models on the data, we also showed that ARIMA(2,1,0) fits the best on the data. We also talk about seasonality shift, and give some argument as to why we think it does not happen.
